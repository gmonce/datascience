				<DocumentPart type="Text"><sentence id="S1.203">As the number of completely sequenced genomes increases, several research groups started to predict proteins that contain stop-codon-encoded amino

knowledge on selenocysteine.</sentence><sentence id="S1.205">In order to improve prediction specificity, they have fully exploited the known features of selenocysteine, such as the SECIS elements or cysteine homologs, which have cysteine in place of selenocysteine.</sentence><sentence id="S1.206">However, since the target of this study is the 23rd amino acid, and there is no a priori knowledge, only general properties of stop-codon-encoded amino acids can be used for prediction.</sentence><sentence id="S1.207">Such general-purpose algorithms have also been developed to

apply their methods to search for novel amino acids.</sentence><sentence id="S1.213">Therefore, the question of the 23rd amino acid has not been investigated from the viewpoint of coding sequences.</sentence><sentence id="S1.214">Additionally, the previous methods cannot effectively discriminate pseudogenes from readthrough genes.</sentence><sentence id="S1.215">For instance, Chaudhuri and Yeates reported a homolog of cobalamin biosynthesis protein CobN as a novel candidate of pyrrolysine protein.</sentence><sentence id="S1.216">However, the gene is <xcope id="X1.216.2"><cue ref="X1.216.2" type="speculation">probably</cue> a pseudogene</xcope> because it contains an inframe TAA codon in addition to the TAG codon, and only <xcope id="X1.216.1">one

barrel fold 6, but their primary sequences do not exhibit detectable similarity to other TIM barrel proteins because of evolutionary divergence.</sentence><sentence id="S1.220">Dimethylamine methyltransferases also lack non-readthrough homologs.</sentence><sentence id="S1.221">Yet another example is glycine reductase selenoprotein A.</sentence><sentence id="S1.222">Only the selenocysteine-containing form of the enzyme is currently known 20.</sentence><sentence id="S1.223">Therefore, it is important not to assume non-readthrough homologs for exploring novel

readthrough genes, even though <xcope id="X1.224.1">they <cue ref="X1.224.1" type="speculation">may</cue> be annotated as pseudogenes</xcope>.</sentence><sentence id="S1.225">However, if all members of a gene family have stop codon readthrough, correct annotation of their gene structure will be extremely difficult, and all of them will be split into two distinct genes.</sentence><sentence id="S1.226">The method reported here is unique in that it does not assume non-readthrough homologs.</sentence><sentence id="S1.227">Using this method, a systematic screening of the 23rd amino acid and other readthrough genes was carried out.</sentence><sentence id="S1.228">Many of the currently known selenoproteins and pyrrolysine proteins were recovered, indicating the effectiveness of this approach.</sentence><sentence id="S1.229">In particular, successful detection of pyrrolysine-containing methyltransferases and selenoprotein A should be noted.</sentence><sentence id="S1.230">However, almost no novel candidates for readthrough genes were predicted.</sentence><sentence id="S1.231">What can be concluded from this result?</sentence><sentence id="S1.232">The most <xcope

its distribution on the tree of life is rather limited</xcope>.</sentence><sentence id="S1.233">Although a broad spectrum of taxonomic groups has been subjected to genome sequencing, the genomes of

appears in younger, non-conserved sequences, our technique will miss them.</sentence><sentence id="S1.238">In either case, the distribution of the 23rd amino acid will be significantly narrower than that of selenocysteine, which has scattered but wide distribution 21.</sentence><sentence id="S1.239">This conclusion coincides with and strengthens that of the previous research on tRNA 14.</sentence><sentence id="S1.240">Yet another <xcope id="X1.240.2"><cue ref="X1.240.2" type="speculation">possibility</cue> is that the 23rd amino acid exists but is not encoded by stop

id="S1.250">Such selenoproteins identified through our screening of nearly 200 microbial genomes were selenoprotein A and only one uncertain candidate.</sentence><sentence id="S1.251">Therefore,
